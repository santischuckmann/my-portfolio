    explanation: "Most of the code in this project was written by me. Nonetheless, this is a college project which has some boilerplate code to aliviate us the task of dealing with things we had not seen in that subject. It was hard to comprehend how to use fundamentals of programming in the context of a game. I wasnÂ´t very keen on this project, but I fell in love with facing problems and the struggle of dealing with them."

    explanation: "This project was the very first thing I built with React. I was learning through a course and we had to built this thing which was meant to show what we have learned so far. I am actually doing more interesting stuff but nonetheless this displays certain skills such as hooks and fetching data from an API."
